    "    <p>This database was created by scraping data from various online sources, each of which used different key identifiers for players. The integration of these datasets was achieved through a combination of player names and the seasons they played. However, due to the presence of homonymous players with overlapping or close career timelines, it was sometimes impossible to accurately map players across all databases.</p>\n",
    "    <p>For example, a player named <code>Josh Powell</code> participated in the <code>2003-04</code> combine. The <code>NCAA</code> database contains two different players named <code>Josh Powell</code>, one with a career spanning from <code>2003</code> to <code>2006</code>, and another from <code>2002</code> to <code>2003</code>. Meanwhile, the <code>NBA</code> database lists a single <code>Josh Powell</code>, whose career ran from <code>2006</code> to <code>2014</code>. This leaves two possible interpretations:</p>    \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>A:</strong> The combine player participated in the combine during the final year of his <code>NCAA</code> career and had a two-year gap before his <code>NBA</code> debut.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>B:</strong> The combine player participated in the combine right after high school and began his professional career immediately following his college years.</li>        \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <p>Another example is the player <code>Matt Carroll</code>. There is a single player named <code>Matt Carroll</code> in both <code>NCAA</code> and <code>NBA</code> datasets, however these entries are for different individuals. Determining the correct connection requires manual intervention, and as such, some links between players may have been made incorrectly. This issue primarily impacts the combine data, so caution is advised when utilizing this portion of the dataset.</p>\n",
    "    <p>The origin of this issue is the sheer frequency of homonymous, specially occurances with a single entry of each in the database. A safe way to avoid this issue is to limit the queries to seasons ranging from 2005 to 2022. As this repository is updated and the issue is resolved, this disclaimer will be removed.</p>\n",
